# Kubernetes Cluster

This is about restoring the Kubernetes cluster.

## Clone and Follow Main Cluster Repo

This repo has most of the instructions necessary for the restoration. Once it is cloned, follow the instructions inside. Of course, all the individual application repos will need to be cloned too.
